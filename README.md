# FivemToolsLib â€” C# QBCore Wrapper & Tools for FiveM

Welcome to **FivemToolsLib**, a utility library designed to bring **QBCore** support and general tooling to **C#-based FiveM resources**.

Whether you're integrating with QBCore from scratch or building complex systems in .NET for your FiveM server, this library aims to streamline common patterns, provide useful abstractions, and reduce boilerplate.

---

## What This Library Offers

- A growing set of **QBCore API wrappers** to simplify interaction from C#
- Utility classes and helper functions tailored for **FiveM server/client scripting**
- Seamless use with existing **FiveM C# projects**
- Documentation generated with **DocFX**, and kept up-to-date via GitHub Pages

> **Note:** This project is in **very early development**. Expect frequent changes and potential breaking updates as the API stabilizes. Contributions and issue reports are welcome!

## Intended Use

- Developers building FiveM resources with C# (.NET)
- Server owners or script authors looking to **integrate QBCore logic** in C# directly
- Anyone wanting clean, reusable tooling in a familiar object-oriented environment
